### System wide configs
System wide configs are in the folder `/etc` + Default configuration for apps and services

### User configs
- Some configs are saved directly in `$HOME` folder and they start with dot (hence the name dot-files) so they are not visible by default
- Other apps have migrated their config to the folder `.config`
